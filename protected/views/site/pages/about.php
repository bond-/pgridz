            <br/>
            <p>Networking is intense!! Our team consists of people who attended some of the world's top business schools.  They participated in networking sessions with senior people, formed crop-circles around recruiters and gathered business cards.How to stand out? This is a question on every candidate's mind, so we tried creating personal rapport with anyone we could. You cannot ask these people to join your social or professional networking site.We scribbled small notes on the back of business cards from everything to what year they graduated to what they liked to eat. All this information came in handy during bank weeks,trips to various company headquarters etc. It was a long cumbersome process.</p>
            <p>PowerGridz.com is the sleek solution. This is not another social networking site. This is your rolodex on the web. You can add notes, opinions, and all the information you can gather about people and someday when you need to know those special details you can access them readily, anytime, anywhere!</p>
